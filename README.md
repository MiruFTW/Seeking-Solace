## **Gameplay**

In *Seeking Solace*, you are trapped in a cursed dungeon where each floor presents new, randomly generated challenges. The further you go, the more powerful enemies become, and each level offers stat upgrades that are essential for survival. Face off against tough bosses at the end of each dungeon, and navigate your way through increasingly difficult challenges.
